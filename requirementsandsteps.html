                    <li><b>Proceed to the Voter's Assistance Desk </b>(VAD). Here, you can get your precinct, queue and room number. </li>
                    <li><b>Go to your assigned room</b>. Present yourself to the Electoral Board in your designated voting room. State your name, precinct number and sequence number.</li>
                    <li><b>Take a ballot</b>. An official will hand you a ballot secrecy folder and a marking pen.</li>
                    <li><b>Fill in the ballot</b>. Fully shade the candidate ovals so that the machine can read your vote. Remember not to over-vote.</li>
                    <li><b>Insert your ballot in the Vote Counting Machine</b> (VCM). Stand by and wait for the machine to process your vote. Do not leave before this is completed.</li>
                    <li><b>Check your voter's receipt</b>. Were your votes processed correctly? If yes, drop the receipt in the provided receptacle. Otherwise, consult the board of elections inspectors and register your complaint. </li>
                    <li><b>Present your forefinger nail for staining.</b> The poll clerk will stain your nail with indelible ink as a mark that you've voted.</li>

                <li><p>Ballot Pen or Marker</p>: Some precincts might provide a pen, but it's better to bring your own to avoid any delays or issues. </li>
